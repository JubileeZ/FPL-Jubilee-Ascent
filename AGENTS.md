## Project Identity

<!-- AGENT: 2–3 sentences. What does this repo do and why does it exist?
     Include the primary user, the core problem it solves, and the output it produces.
     Example: "Order management API for an e-commerce platform. Handles cart, checkout,
     and fulfillment state. Consumed by web and mobile frontends via REST." -->

**Stack:** <!-- AGENT: list primary language, runtime version, key frameworks, and package manager.
              Example: Python 3.12 · uv · FastAPI · PostgreSQL · SQLAlchemy · pytest -->

**Monorepo:** yes / no <!-- AGENT: delete one -->

---

## Key Commands

<!-- AGENT: Fill in the exact commands an agent needs to install, test, lint, and run this project.
     Use the actual package manager and toolchain. Do not use generic placeholders. -->

| Command | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| (add your lint command here) | Lint |
| (add your test command here) | Test |

**Pre-commit gate:** agents must run test and lint commands and confirm both pass before proposing any commit.

## Repo Structure

<!-- AGENT: List top-level directories and key subdirectories only. Keep to ≤ 15 lines.
     Annotate each line with a short purpose comment.
     Example:
     src/
       api/        # route handlers
       models/     # Pydantic schemas and ORM models
       services/   # business logic, no framework imports
       db/         # migrations and connection setup
     tests/        # mirrors src/ structure
     docs/         # ADRs and architecture notes
     .env.example  # copy to .env, never commit .env
-->

```

## Off-Limits: Never Touch Without Explicit Instruction

<!-- AGENT: List files, dirs, or operations that are dangerous to modify autonomously.
     These are hard stops — flag and wait for confirmation before proceeding.
     Defaults below are universal; add project-specific entries. -->

- `.env` and any file containing secrets or credentials
- Database migrations — always flag, never auto-apply or auto-run
- Production configuration files
- Any file marked `# DO NOT EDIT` or `# GENERATED`
- <!-- AGENT: add project-specific off-limits entries, e.g. vendored lock files, parquet datasets, etc. -->

---

## Safety Rules

<!-- AGENT: Supplement global safety rules with rules specific to this repo's risk profile.
     The rules below are universal defaults — keep them and add project-specific ones below. -->

**Universal (keep always):**
- Never commit secrets, tokens, or credentials to any file.
- Destructive operations (delete, overwrite, truncate, drop) require an inline comment:
  `# DESTRUCTIVE: <reason this is safe to proceed>`
- Never add a new top-level dependency without flagging it explicitly in your response.
- Prefer reversible actions. When an irreversible action is required, state it clearly before executing.

**Project-specific:**
- <!-- AGENT: Add rules relevant to this codebase. Examples:
       "Never mutate raw input files — always write to a new output path."
       "All external API calls must go through src/clients/, never inline."
       "Tests must not make real network calls — use fixtures or mocks." -->

---

## Code Conventions

<!-- AGENT: Only document conventions that deviate from obvious defaults or language standards.
     Skip this section if the project follows standard style with no notable exceptions.
     Examples of what belongs here:
     - "All service functions return Result objects, not raw values or exceptions."
     - "Type hints required on all public functions and class attributes."
     - "No bare except: — always catch specific exception types."
     - "Tests live beside source (src/foo/tests/), not in a top-level tests/ dir." -->

- <!-- AGENT: fill in or remove -->

---

## Known Footguns

<!-- AGENT: Gotchas that will silently burn an agent or produce wrong output.
     These are non-obvious traps — if it's obvious, skip it.
     Examples:
     - "uv run is required — do not call python directly, the venv won't activate."
     - "The ORM session is not thread-safe — never share it across async tasks."
     - "Config is loaded once at import time — changes to .env require a process restart."
     - "Pagination is 0-indexed on the internal API but 1-indexed on the public API." -->

- <!-- AGENT: fill in or remove -->

---

## MCP / Tool Access

<!-- AGENT: Tell agents what external tools, MCP servers, or integrations are active in this context.
     Remove this section entirely if no MCP tools are connected.
     Examples:
     - "GitHub MCP connected — use for PR creation and issue lookup, not raw git push."
     - "No internet access in the CI container — all data must be pre-fetched locally."
     - "Database MCP available — read queries allowed, write queries require confirmation." -->

- <!-- AGENT: fill in or remove this section -->

---

## Agent Behavior Overrides

<!-- AGENT: Override global defaults ONLY when this project specifically needs it.
     Leave this section empty or remove it if global defaults are fine.
     Examples:
     - "caveman: OFF for all reasoning steps — show full logic chain, this is a debugging-heavy repo."
     - "ponytail: PuLP and NumPy are pre-approved dependencies, do not flag them as new."
     - "Auto-proceed on file edits within src/ — no confirmation needed for non-destructive writes." -->

- <!-- AGENT: fill in or remove this section -->
