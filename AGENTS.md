## Project Identity

<!-- AGENT: 2–3 sentences. What does this repo do and why does it exist?
     Include the primary user, the core problem it solves, and the output it produces.
     Example: "Order management API for an e-commerce platform. Handles cart, checkout,
     and fulfillment state. Consumed by web and mobile frontends via REST." -->

**Stack:** <!-- AGENT: list primary language, runtime version, key frameworks, and package manager.
              Example: Python 3.12 · uv · FastAPI · PostgreSQL · SQLAlchemy · pytest -->

**Monorepo:** no

---

## Repo Structure

<!-- AGENT: List top-level directories and key subdirectories only. Keep to ≤ 15 lines.
     Annotate each line with a short purpose comment. -->

```
<repo structure here>
```

---

## Key Commands

| Command | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| (add your lint command here) | Lint |
| (add your test command here) | Test |

**Pre-commit gate:** agents must run test and lint commands and confirm both pass before proposing any commit.

## Off-Limits: Never Touch Without Explicit Instruction

- `.env` and any file containing secrets or credentials
- Database migrations — always flag, never auto-apply or auto-run
- Production configuration files
- Any file marked `# DO NOT EDIT` or `# GENERATED`
- <!-- AGENT: add project-specific off-limits entries, e.g. vendored lock files, etc. -->

---

## Project-Specific Safety Rules

- <!-- AGENT: Add safety rules specific to this codebase that agents must follow.
     Example: "Never run tests against the production database." -->

---

## Code Conventions

- <!-- AGENT: Document conventions specific to this codebase that deviate from defaults or language standards.
     Example: "Use strict type annotations for all new Python functions." -->

---

## Agent Behavior Overrides

- Keep project documentation edits (AGENTS.md, ROADMAP.md, current-state.md, etc.) telegraphic: no articles, no filler, concise fragments.
- <!-- AGENT: List custom rules that override default agent behaviors or define project-specific constraints.
     Example: "- ponytail: Python and uv are pre-approved stack requirements." -->

<!-- AZG:MANAGED:START -->
## Session start

1. Read `docs/agents/current-state.md` (if unfamiliar with repo state).
2. Read `ROADMAP.md` (first unchecked item in active phase).
3. Read `task.md` / open issues (if present).
4. Run `git log -5 --oneline` + `git status` (to sync history).
5. Do not rely on chat history.

---

## Universal Safety Rules

- No secrets/tokens/credentials in any file.
- Destructive ops (delete/overwrite/truncate/drop): inline `# DESTRUCTIVE: <reason>`.
- No new top-level dependencies without flagging in response.
- Agent harness device changes: implement scalably for current/future devices and new repos.
- Prefer reversible actions. If irreversible, state clearly before executing.
- Tool blocked by safety hook? Explain block, suggest exact command/content to write manually.
- Windows: run CLI/hooks only inside Git Bash.

---

## Domain Vocabulary

- Ambiguous terminology? Read `docs/agents/domain.md`.
- New terms? Create `CONTEXT.md` at root from `docs/agents/CONTEXT.md.tmpl` to register glossary.

---

## Progress & Issues

- Progress workflow: read `docs/agents/progress.md`.
- Issue tracker setup: read `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md`.
- Compaction: collapse completed phase checklists in `ROADMAP.md` to a single header/summary line (Active-Phase Compaction).
- Cleanup: delete transient session files (`task.md`, `implementation_plan.md`, `walkthrough.md`) once milestone/task is complete.
